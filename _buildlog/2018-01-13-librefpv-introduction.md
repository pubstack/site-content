The initial idea of LibreFPV arises from the need
to design and build FPV glasses that allow
have a design, modular and enough
flexible so that it can be used in
other solutions like HMD.

#### Frontal view

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="float-right mt-0" src="/assets/librefpv_buildlog/media/2018-01-11_11-34-34-init.png" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
The front view shows that it will be a design
compact, with two individual screens, one for each eye.
Having a compact design will allow them to be left
put on not flying.

        </p>
</div>

#### Rear view

<div class="nk-post-text mt-0">
    <img style="height: 155px;" class="float-left mt-0" src="/assets/librefpv_buildlog/media/2018-01-11_11-34-57-init.png" alt="">
        <p class="text-white">
The overall design will have to have lateral space to add components, also access
to the video recorder, standard strap, fan, among others.
        </p>
</div>

#### LibreFPV features

Advantages:

* Light and comfortable, for not having a single screen larger.
* Easy to focus, since it will have a mechanism of adjusting both focus and interpupillary distance.
* Easy to carry because it has a compact size.


Disadvantages:

* Extremely high cost compared to the box glasses, this condition must be corrected.
* It will not work with glasses, most FPV glasses need additional diopter correction.
* Usually, a field of vision smaller than the box glasses.

Madrid, the historic capital of Spain, attarcts a great deal of tourists throughout the year;
its beautiful climate and cultural life make it a major destination. The Prado museum, boasting
masterpieces signed Rubens, Raphaël, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Picasso, Goya or Vélasquez, is as
much a success story as the Thyssen-Bornemisza museum with its collection of Italian and
Flemish primitives, expressionists and impressionists.

The famed Plaza del Toros is the largest arena in the city,
proving that nothing sparks up a festive ambiance like watching
a matador dancing with death. Nothing, except perhaps seeing
Real Madrid on the football pitch.

## Advanced professional drone pilot license

To be able to carry out aerial work it is necessary to complete
a theoretical training (available online), and a training
practice that includes training flights. This last
part is 100% face-to-face.

Mobus facilitates the complete course in one of its
multirotor to € 650, a round number and no small print.

However, if you have some type of flight license,
it is very likely that you have validated the theoretical part.

  </ul>
<div class="tab-content">

<p>
It consists of a total of 60 hours. Although the course can be done online, 10% of the training must be face-to-face. This part is carried out in the facilities of the ATO "Flyschool", our collaborating entity in the issuance of the license.

The categories where pilots can compete are given
by certain parameters that aircraft must comply with.

All registered drivers will receive a pack of
welcome with the rules of the event and
goodies of the sponsors / collaborators.

In formula-d there are two different competitions that will be
described below and each
of them should be classified within each of the
following categories shown on this page.

{: .text-main-1}
## PRO competition, rounds of double eliminations

In this competition a total of 16 pilots will participate,
12 professional pilots and the best 4 pilots in the OPEN category.

The competition will be held under the modality
"Compass Draw Tournament" or double elimination tournament.

The 12 pilots selected for the PRO competition will
receive a unique 500 Eur reimbursement for travel expenses.

Each round will last 6 laps of the course.
For each group of 4 pilots, the first two pilots, to reach the finish line and finish the 6 laps in the shortest possible time, will pass to
the next round.
The two pilots remaining in the third and fourth positions of the round will have the possibility
to return to compete in the corresponding round.
Pilots who have lost two (2) rounds will be definitively eliminated from the competition.
The pilots who compete in the final round will obtain the following prizes:

|           | Metallic | Trophy | Sponsors products |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| 1st Place | 1500 Eur | Yes    | Yes               |
| 2nd Place | 750 Eur  | Yes    | Yes               |
| 3rd Place | 500 Eur  | Yes    | Yes               |
| 4th Place | -        | Yes    | Yes               |

## OPEN Competition

This competition is open to all pilots to participate,
and is designed and thought for pilots without professional experience.

Each pilot inroled in the OPEN category will
need to pay a tuition fee of 20 Eur.

The competition will be held under the modality
of elimination for greater time.

Each group of 6 pilots will run 3 rounds (races).
Each round will last 4 laps of the course.
Each driver will add his two (2) best times obtained in the rounds, for the general classification.
The four (4) best pilots (least accumulated times) will receive the following prizes:

{: .nk-table}
|           | Metallic | Trophy | Sponsors products | Classification to the PRO competition |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1st Place | 150 Eur  | Yes    | Yes               | Yes                                   |

### Categories of competitions

Below are the different categories in which the drivers can compete,
These categories will be specified at the beginning of each competition.


{: .text-main-1}
#### Classes are important for the following reasons

{: .text-white}
+ They allow to level the flight field, in this way no pilot
will have advantages over others when using more powerful equipment.
This allows the driver to win the race, not his kit.
+ Aircraft can be designed with confidence and
that will be accepted in the competition.
+ They will allow to determine that the radiofrequency emitting components
they will be compatible and will not cause interference.

Class 3S class includes drones suitable for both beginners and professionals.
Pilots can control their aircraft without fear of their teams overcoming their skills
Of flight. However, it still offers power to perform
high speed racing.

Class 4S class includes drones suitable for advanced FPV racing pilots.
Pilots must have a skill level high enough to
control the aircraft appropriately or they will overload quickly and lose
the precision needed to compete competitively.

The open class is available for all multi-drivers.
This class is designed to promote competition among all
the styles and configurations of aircraft to help develop
the innovation in technology and design.

#### Comments

{: .text-white}
+ Remember, classes are guidelines to provide competitive standards
Within a typical day of racing in Formula-D.

+ Many pilots will ask why the power limit of the transmitter
Video (VTx) is set to 250 mW. This is to increase the rate
of success of multiple pilots who have a perfect video transmission
clear. If some pilots are transmitting at a higher power, the
probability of experiencing frequency problems increases.

+ As the new technology is launched, classes and specifications will be
will be updated to incorporate or retain progress to maintain competition
loyal as the number one priority.

+ All aircraft must be built with the ability to easily change
vTx channels in a timely and accurate manner.

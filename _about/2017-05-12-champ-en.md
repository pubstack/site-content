The formula-d drone racing championship is a
event initially created in Spain, which provides
local pilots the opportunity to compete in a
professional atmosphere where they can improve their
abilities. It also tries to bring new
pilots without experience to this hobby offering
an open race to all riders regardless of their
experience.

The event was created in 2017 with a small
group of pilots as a demonstration to be able to test
our infrastructure and equipment.

The formula-d drone racing championship is a
event initially created in Spain, which provides
local pilots the opportunity to compete in a
professional atmosphere where they can improve their
abilities. It also tries to bring new
pilots without experience to this hobby offering
an open race to all riders regardless of their
experience.

The event was created in 2017 with a small
group of pilots as a demonstration to be able to test
our infrastructure and equipment.

This is our logo, it represents the fusion between the two words
that define the name of our event, F for the word formula and D for the
drone word.
These two letters are intertwined and making a
simile to a hexagon, which in turn represents one of the basic forms of
the hexacopter where each corner represents one of its motors.
The colors white and red represent the philosophy of our event.
The white represents the simplicity and harmony between the competitors, the
organization and the public.
Red represents the intensity with which we represent this hobby that joins us
as pilots.

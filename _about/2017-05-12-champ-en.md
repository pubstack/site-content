The formula-d drone racing championship is a
event initially created in Spain, which provides
local pilots the opportunity to compete in a
professional atmosphere where they can improve their
abilities. It also tries to bring new
pilots without experience to this hobby offering
an open race to all riders regardless of their
experience.

The event was created in 2017 with a small
group of pilots as a demonstration to be able to test
our infrastructure and equipment.

This is our logo, it represents the fusion between the two words
that define the name of our event, F for the word formula and D for the
drone word.
These two letters are intertwined and making a
simile to a hexagon, which in turn represents one of the basic forms of
the hexacopter where each corner represents one of its motors.
The colors white and red represent the philosophy of our event.
The white represents the simplicity and harmony between the competitors, the
organization and the public.
Red represents the intensity with which we represent this hobby that joins us
as pilots.

### Gender equality and inclussion

Gender inequality is an affront to human dignity,
a challenge to the rule of law and an obstacle to development.
Denying women of their rightful place in society - by depriving them of equal access to education, sports,
justice or livelihood - means robbing societies of
the talent and potential of half of their members.

#### There are several facts that incourage us to push forward to include general gender equality politics in our event.

* Two thirds of children aged nine to eleven draw a man when asked to draw a scientist. 
* 16% of university are female.
* formula-d aim to eliminate this stereotype and bias whilst emphasising real-life applications in sports. 
* 70% of sports now offer the same amount of
prize money for men and women. But in the 30%
that don’t, the difference runs into the millions.
* There are 2million more men than women taking part in sport at least once per week.
* 0.4% of the total commercial investment in sport goes into women’s sport.
* Only half of the governing bodies in sport currently meet the government
target to have women making up one quarter of the people sitting around the
boardroom table.
* Men’s professional soccer clubs in Europe are the world’s wealthiest sports
entities and at least 10 European soccer players earn more than $14 million per year.
* When it comes to women, tennis is by far the most lucrative sport for female
athletes.
* Coaches in women’s team sports at college level earn 63 cents for every dollar
earned by head Coaches of men’s teams

#### Support and improve gender equality in formula-d

We believe that gender equality in science,
technology, engineering, sports, and politics
among many others build stronger societies.

formula-d generates conversation around gender equality in sports,
using the world of drone races to inspire and provide a platform for
a change to occur, we try to build high quality leadership
and learning opportunities through drone education.

#### Why drones?

There are so many different applications within the world of drones, so we
believe there is an aspect of this technology that will strike a chord with
everyone. Through activities as diverse as aerial survey, obstacle courses,
parcel delivery, creative art, and of course drone races, drones are so much fun
that you forget you are even learning. 


Gender equality in sports has always been a controversial topic.
Even the founder of the modern Olympics, Baron Pierre de Coubertin,
said in 1896, “No matter how toughened a sportswoman may be, her
organism is not cut out to sustain certain shocks.”

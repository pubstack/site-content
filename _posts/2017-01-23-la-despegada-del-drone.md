The first time Justin “JReyFPV” Baltazar piloted a racing drone, he had an “out-of-body” experience.



Drone racing lifts off, delivering ‘out of body’ experiences
============================================================



“It was just a huge adrenaline rush, like I’m actually flying, but I’m not flying, I’m still on the ground,” the Santa Clara resident said last week as he competed for the title of California’s fastest drone pilot. “It was crazy.”

Pilots like Baltazar wear goggles to view video from a drone-mounted camera. This tricks their minds into thinking they’re actually riding aboard a craft the size of a folded sheet of paper.

To date, drones are best known for aerial photography and more speculative pursuits like package delivery. But now racing them has caught on, and some say the high-speed, relatively low-cost competition could be the next big tech-driven sport. In just two years, the sport has evolved from grassroots meet-ups of hobbyists gathering in parks, forests, warehouses or breweries to formal, sanctioned races and a TV series broadcast on ESPN. In September, the Reno Air Races — a showcase for regular aircraft for the last half-century — will for the first time include national championship races for drones.

Last Thursday, San Francisco’s Aerial Sports League — one of the first groups in the country to organize drone competitions — turned the Palace of Fine Arts Theater into a looping, quarter-mile indoor drone drag race course, filled with the loud whiney buzz of drones speeding more than 100 mph. The event drew 16 pilots from throughout California, from ages 11 to 45.

Although the invitation-only event was not televised live, NBC Sports Bay Area plans to produce a half-hour highlight show and drone racing documentary to debut on the local sports channel on Aug. 1.

“I think it will become a big spectator sport,” said Baltazar, 28, who’s also part of a group of drone owners who practice almost every weeknight in Sunnyvale’s Baylands Park. “This is going to be the next version of NASCAR.”

The drone racing industry has a long way to go before it becomes as popular as auto races or other traditional sports. But it is the latest in a new generation of technology-fueled electronic sports, or e-sports, that is attracting attention from major corporate sponsors and media companies. The burgeoning popularity of professional video game tournaments has helped drone racing catch on.

ESPN’s Drone Racing League series, now in a second season, has given the sport a major stage. Last month, the league, a New York startup, completed a $20 million round of financing that included Liberty Media, which owns Formula 1 racing, and British satellite TV company Sky. (Another investor is Hearst Ventures, a division of Hearst, the owner of The Chronicle.)

Communications giant Comcast, meanwhile, sponsored last week’s $10,000 Xfinity California Drone Speed Challenge, organized by the Aerial Sports League.

Network executives are eager to find new forms of sports entertainment programming. And drone racing is so new that it’s still inexpensive to produce, said Adam Jones, who leads the sports and entertainment industry section of the consulting firm PwC.

“The type of investment that we’re seeing made in drone racing properties signals there is that potential” to become a mainstream sport, Jones said.

Although a British teen won $250,000 for winning a world drone tournament in Dubai last year, drone pilots — who use aviator call signs like airplane pilots — interviewed at the San Francisco race said they weren’t making enough to quit their day jobs.

San Francisco resident Colby “SFPV” Curtola, 28, who works for drone mapping company Skycatch, won the event, but he noted the $5,000 top prize wasn’t huge. “My girlfriend hates me because I fly drones all day,” he joked. “So I’m going to buy her something nice with the prize money. And that will pay rent for a month.”

The Aerial Sports League started in 2012 to build a community of drone pilots but soon moved into manufacturing durable racing drone frames. It’s now pivoted to organizing events, such as the drone drag race.

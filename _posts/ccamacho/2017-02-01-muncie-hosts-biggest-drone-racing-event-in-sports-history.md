MUNCIE, Ind. (WTHR) â€“ The Academy of Model Aeronautics in Muncie is hosting the biggest drone racing event ever this week. 350 pilots from around the world are racing on eight courses spread throughout the 1,200-acre grounds. The MultiGP International Open runs through Sunday.


Muncie hosts biggest drone racing event in sport's history
==========================================================

Eleven-year-old Ashton Gamble from Los Angeles calls himself "Drobot Racer." While he sits in a chair under a tent wearing first person view (FPV) goggles, his father Rand stands behind him looking at a handheld monitor. The screen shows Rand the same camera shot from the drone that Ashton sees to pilot his quad drone through a series of gates on the course located about 30 yards from the tent. The quads twist and turn through the air at about 60 miles an hour.

"In the race, you don't go that fast, because if you're going 100 miles an hour you can't control it," said Ashton, who will begin sixth grade later this month. "But these can go 100 and something easily."

Ashton sits in line of eight pilots under the edge of the tent, all wearing goggles and holding a remote control with two joysticks to maneuver their quads.
